## Pre-requisites

node v20.14.0  
npm v10.7.0  

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the app

```bash
npx nx start mobile
```

## The issue

Nativewind V4 is not working with Expo Router.

For example the `Text` component in `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` is not styled.

```tsx
<Text className="text-red-500 text-2xl">Tab One</Text>
```

Adding `verifyInstallation` to `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` will print the following error:
```tsx
const isNativeWindVerified = verifyInstallation();
console.log('isNativeWindVerified', isNativeWindVerified);
```

```
ERROR  Error: Nativewind received no data. Please refer to http://nativewind.dev/troubleshooting#no-data
